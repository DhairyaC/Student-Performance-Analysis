Problem Statement: Educational data mining focuses on developing different methods for solving educational problems which are hidden in an education field. The major problem which is faced in an education field is ‘Student Dropouts or Failure’. There are many factors which are influencing the student dropouts. Many Data mining methods are used for identifying and predicting student’s failure. A student failure is a major social problem where educational professionals need to understand the causes, why many students fail in completing their education.

Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost.

BI Decision: Assigning research-based topics to students help them explore the online resources for their survey. Moreover, regular class test results will provide how attentive and interactive the students are in the class while lecture delivery. Furthermore, an eye should be kept on how frequently the students check the announcements made by the professor and be strictly followed.
